# Gesture-Controlled Car Racing Game

🚗 **Control any game using hand gestures with AI/ML!**

---

## 📌 Overview
The **Gesture-Controlled Car Racing Game** (GCG) is an AI/ML-powered project built to provide an accessible gaming experience — especially for people with physical disabilities — by allowing them to control games with hand gestures of their choice. Whether you're playing a racing game, platformer, or FPS, GCG lets you swap traditional keyboard inputs with customized gesture-to-key mappings.

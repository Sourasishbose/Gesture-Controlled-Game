Gesture-Controlled Car Racing Game
🚗 Control any game using hand gestures with AI/ML!

📌 Overview
The Gesture-Controlled Car Racing Game (GCG) is an AI/ML-powered project built to provide an accessible gaming experience — especially for people with physical disabilities — by allowing them to control games with hand gestures of their choice. Whether you're playing a racing game, platformer, or FPS, GCG lets you swap traditional keyboard inputs with customized gesture-to-key mappings.

✨ Features
🎮 Gesture-Based Controls – Move, jump, accelerate, or perform any in-game action using real-time hand tracking.
🧠 CNN-Based Gesture Recognition – Deep learning model trained using TensorFlow for high-accuracy gesture detection.
🎥 Webcam Only – No special hardware required.
⚡ Real-Time & Responsive – Minimal latency for a seamless gaming experience.
🧩 Custom Gesture-to-Key Mapping – Fully configurable key bindings based on user gestures.
🌍 Cloud-Synced Gesture Profiles – Supports multiple saved settings per user account.
🎮 Supports All PC Games – Any game that accepts keyboard inputs can be controlled.
🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools:
OpenCV – real-time video feed
